REFLECTION

1. **Were your predictions right?**
Most of my predictions were right. I expected Saturday to have the highest screen time and Friday to be my best focus day, and both were confirmed. I also predicted that increased caffeine would not improve my focus, and the results showed that my average focus was higher on days with less caffeine.

2. **What surprised you?**
I was surprised by the data showing that caffeine did not improve my focus. I expected caffeine to increase my productivity, but after calculating the averages, my focus was actually lower on the day with the highest caffeine intake.

3. **What was tricky or rewarding?**
The trickiest part was figuring out how to loop through the data and keep track of totals and counts, especially in functions like mostFrequentMood and correlateCaffeineToFocus. The most rewarding part was seeing the console output work correctly.

4. **How did using your own data change things?**
I tried using the data as accurately as possible, which was actually helpful in determining how much I am sleeping, how much I am on my phone, and how my mood could be affected.
